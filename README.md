# Pokemon-Arena

Pokemon Arena is a gauntlet style, turn-based battle game where the player has to create a team of battle-hungry creatures
known as Pokemon and battle against other competing Pokemon. Should they defeat all of their opponents, 
they will be crowned "Trainer Supreme" and recieve all the bragging rights in the world. 

The game is entirely text-based, 
featuring a very basic story and gameplay elements paying tribute to the original Pokemon video game series.
